## Introduction

**Photosensitive Seizure Warning: This project involves bright flashing lights! It may not be suitable if there are sufferers of epilepsy present.**

These Sushi Cards will show you how to use wearable LEDs that can be programmed and how to control them with code.

### What you will make

In this project you will sew LED lights to a t-shirt and program them to flash and change colours by writing code! 

### What you will learn

+ Testing NeoPixels
+ Stitching a NeoPixel circuit with positive, negative and data flow
+ The flow of a Flora program (setup and loop functions)
+ Turning NeoPixels on and off
+ Addressing individual NeoPixels
+ RGB colour mixing
+ Functions and parameters
for loops
+ Exploring more advanced examples
